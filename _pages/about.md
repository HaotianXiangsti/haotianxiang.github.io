I am Haotian Xiang (向昊天). The pronunciation is close to /haʊˈtiːən/ /ʃjɑŋ/. 

I am currently a senior master student in the [Electrical Engineering](https://www.ee.columbia.edu/ee-research) department of Columbia University. Before that, I have completed my B.Sc. with first class honor in the Information Engineering department from [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China](https://en.uestc.edu.cn/) (UESTC).

I am the Transformer Generation !
======
My research has been closely intertwined with the Transformer based model. From the inception of the Transformer Encoder to Visual Transformer (ViT), and further into the realms of Multimodal domain (ALBEF) and Spatial-Temporal Attention (ASTGCN), my work has revolved around exploring the applications of the Transformer model in various domains. I'd like to explore more possibilities of applying Transformer based model to tackle frontier issues.
